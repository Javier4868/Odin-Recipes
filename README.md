# Odin-Recipes

This project is intended to be a visual testament and representation of the skills I have learned so far, as it relates to HTML and CSS

The aim is to build a webpage revolving around recipies that also uses multi-page functionality

It may look choppy, but as long as its function, I will have succeeded.
